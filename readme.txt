but for tags, and as such takes the same arguments.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this work with other versions of WordPress? =

Probably!  If you've got a version other than 2.6.1 and it works, let me know and I'll update the requirements.

= Why doesn't one of the wp_list_categories() arguments work with list_tags()? =

Not all of them have been tested.  If there seems to be a problem, let me know at http://www.stevesmith1983.co.uk.
